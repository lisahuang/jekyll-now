title: Build Your Blog in 5 Minutes!
---

Every developer should have a blog. Many posts explained why such as [this post](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/every-developer-should-have-a-blog-heres-why-and-how-to-stick-with-it-5fd55a247fbf). There are many ways to host your blog. I choose github pages because it is easy to setup and maintain. I followed [this article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) and built my blog site. It is simple and fast. Enjoy the journel.
