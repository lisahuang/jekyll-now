Your interview’s success depends on the quality of your preparation. Here are six steps to follow as you prepare for your interview:

Step 1: Do Your Homework
A company is more than facts, products, and statistics. You want to know what it’s really like to work there. Spend time on Glassdoor company reviews, salary reports, and interview reviews and questions. You can get a good idea of the type of questions you will be asked.

Before the interview, find out:

Why the position is open. (Is this a new position? How long was the last person in the role? Where they promoted?)
How long the position has been open. (Has it been hard to fill? Or have they just started looking?)
The size of the company
The company’s primary business
Use social media, especially LinkedIn and your network, to research the company and the interviewer. Spend a little bit of time on Twitter, too. Search the company and see what employees, customers, and clients are saying about them. You can also find out key information from the recruitment agency or Human Resources.

You may also be asked to take a skill or personality assessment. These assessments are a way to measure how well you match the job. There isn’t a way to prepare ahead of time for these assessments, so just relax and be as honest as possible. If you are in the technical or scientific fields, you may also be asked to prove your technical knowledge. Be prepared to showcase your knowledge to an expert in the technology they are seeking.

Step 2: Know Your Accomplishment Stories
At this point you’ve probably seen a job description that includes the skills, competencies, and other requirements for the job. You need to show the interviewer that your capabilities are a good match for the job. Prepare a worksheet that lists the job criteria (requirements) expressed as tasks, responsibilities, competencies, skills or traits appear on the job posting. Reflect on your background and experience to select accomplishments that give the best evidence of your capabilities as they relate to the employer's needs. See below for examples on how to take generic job criteria and turn it into a story worth telling.

Job criteria	Strong accomplishment statements
Creative problem solver	While working at XYZ company, I came up with a consolidated template that streamlined the process by eliminating the need for several clicks when inputting data.
Excellent communication skills	I helped keep a half million dollar account by explaining the order delay and negotiating a new delivery date, which exceeded the customer’s expectations.
It’s a good idea to prepare more accomplishment statements than you included in your resume. They provide proof that you demonstrated a wide range of skills for previous employers, and you will do the same for your new boss. Don’t forget to SOAR! (Hyperlink SOAR doc)

Step 3: Prepare Questions
Interviewing is a two-way street and should be considered a dialogue. By asking thoughtful questions, you communicate your interest and learn a lot about the job and the company. Consider asking questions such as:

What is the work environment like here?
What kind of person does well here?
How would you describe your management style?
How are decisions made?
What is the greatest challenge a new person may face getting started?


Don’t ask a lot of questions about vacation time, coffee breaks, and sick leave. It will appear that your main interest is relaxation, not working.

Review sample questions to ask at the interview and select the questions that are most relevant to you situation and open position.

4: Prepare for Behavioral-Based Questions
In addition to the typical interview questions, you can expect to be asked how you acted in specific employee-related situations. The logic behind these questions is that how you behaved in the past will predict how you will behave in the future.

Questions are open-ended, which means you can respond with as much or little detail as you deem appropriate. Consider using the SOAR framework to provide the best response whenever possible.

Behavioral interview questions usually begin with words like:

Describe a time when you?
Give an example of …?
How did you handle ...?
General answers are not what the interviewer wants. You must describe in detail a particular event, project, or experience, how you dealt with the situation, and what the outcome was. While you cannot prepare specific answers to behavioral or hypothetical questions, review your accomplishments so that you can demonstrate that you possess the skills in question.

Beyond behavior-based questions, you might encounter any combination of difficult interview questions, some of which may seem inappropriate. Try not to take inappropriate questions personally or be offended – remember, not every interviewer is professionally trained. Responding with humour, or with a question expressed pleasantly and without belligerence, can prevent an awkward impasse.

Step 5: Practice Aloud
This may seem awkward at first, but it’s the best way to rehearse your answers. It’s one thing to think about what you’re going to say, and another to actually say it while observing yourself, or being observed for feedback. You can practice with others, in front of a mirror, video yourself with your mobile device, or use the LHH Interview Center.

While reviewing your practice interview, pay attention to:

What you say: The actual meaning that you convey.
How you say it: Your choice of words, words you omit, and how you build your case. For instance, “I do best in a flexible environment,” is preferable to, “I hated the petty rules and regulations at my last job.”
Body language and tone of voice: Do they support what you’re saying, or contradict it? If you are claiming to be energetic and motivated, speak with conviction and sit forward in your chair. It would be hard for an interviewer to believe you if you rarely talked above a whisper and leaned back or slouched down in your chair throughout the interview.
Your communication style: Be prepared to apply the iSPEAK® techniques. This will help you focus on other people as you strive to analyze their style and adapt your own.
Step 6: Pack Light
When deciding what to bring to your interview, keep it minimal:

A portfolio to hold and protect papers
Tablet, notebook, pen to jot down important information or schedule next interview. We suggest that you don’t take extensive notes during the interview because it prevents you from making good eye contact with the interviewer, which is needed to build rapport. However, capture key words or phrases to help you recall important facts and information. You can expend your notes immediately after the interview, while it’s fresh in your mind.
What about your resume and reference list? Bring them, just in case. The interviewer likely received your resume ahead of time, but if they ask for it, you can give them a copy.

And while you should have a reference list ready if needed, sending it after the fact is a great way to follow up and continue the conversation. See Develop a Sample Reference List for more.

Step 7: Evaluate Your Digital Footprint
While you’re doing homework for your interview, the interviewer is also doing homework on you. Make sure you’re sending the right (and most current) message.

Update your LinkedIn profile with a current photo, job responsibilities, and achievements. Ask for recommendations from colleagues if you haven’t already. Make sure your resume is up to date.
Check your profile settings on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Turn on privacy settings so that only friends can view your profile, and limit past posts if they were ever made public. Disable the option for people to tag you in pictures and videos.
Google yourself. Once you’ve made the updates, see what’s out there when you Google your own name. Modify anything that comes up that you’d rather not be seen by the public.
