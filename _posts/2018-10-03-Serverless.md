Serverless Framework:
1. Chalice (Python)
Chalice is a framework by AWS for writing serverless applications in Python, and allows to quickly create and deploy applications that use AWS Lambda. Chalice provides a command line tool for creating, deploying, and managing apps, integration with common AWS services, and automatic IAM policy generation. Chalice is [available on GitHub] (https://github.com/aws/chalice).
2. Zappa (Python)
3. Sparta (Go)
4. Apex (Go)
Apex is a framework which aims to let you easily build, deploy, and manage AWS Lambda. One of the key features of Apex is the ability to use languages that are not natively supported by AWS Lambda through the use of a Node.js shim injected into the build. In addition to building and deploying the functions, other related tools provide testing, deployment roll-backs, and log tailing. Apex is [available on GitHub] (https://github.com/apex/apex).
