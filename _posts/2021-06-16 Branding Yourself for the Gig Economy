As an independent worker, your product is your brand. You need to market yourself and your work to find that next gig. To build your brand:

Know Yourself
Your brand should be authentic to you, relevant, and unique. Define who you are, what drives you, and what you can offer. This will help you connect to individuals and hiring managers who want to buy what you’re selling!

Establish an Online Presence
Marketing yourself is a lot easier if you can be found online. More often than not, people will turn to Google to find what they’re looking for or scope out prospective employees. Create a personal website with a URL that’s relevant to you (your name) or your business. Make sure your social media platforms align with the image you want to project, or set up separate professional profiles. Lock down your privacy settings on your personal profiles – even if you’ve already done it. Privacy policies change often and it could be worth double checking.

Network
Networking is extremely valuable during this time and it should be a primary focus as you pick up a contract or gig opportunity. Network within the organization you are working for and with external clients, vendors, distributors – anyone who can see your work and the value you bring to the table. Remember, identifying and cultivating strong, trusting relationships with both influencers and decisions makers within these organizations will directly impact your success in securing future work.



Establishing and maintaining a strong brand is key to success in the freelance world. The more people who notice you and your brand, the better your chances are of being asked for more work, getting an extension of your contract, or even being offered a full-time opportunity if you’d like one!
